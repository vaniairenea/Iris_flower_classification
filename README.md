# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification 🌸

## 📖 Introduction
The **Iris Flower Classification** project is a classic example of supervised machine learning. This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica, based on the length and width of their sepals and petals.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous **Iris dataset** provided by [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html). It contains 150 observations with 4 features each: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Programming language
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting library
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing library

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations were created to understand the distribution and relationships between features, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## 📈 Model Training and Evaluation
We used a **Decision Tree Classifier** to train the model and evaluated its performance.

### Steps Involved
1. **Loading the Dataset**: The Iris dataset was loaded using scikit-learn.
2. **Data Preparation**: A DataFrame was created and features were defined.
3. **Data Splitting**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Initialization**: The Decision Tree Classifier was initialized.
5. **Model Training**: The classifier was trained using the training data.
6. **Model Prediction**: Predictions were made on the test data.
7. **Model Evaluation**: The accuracy of the model was calculated.

### Results
- The model achieved an accuracy of **95%** on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between the different species of iris flowers.

### Visualization
- The structure of the Decision Tree was visualized using matplotlib, showing how decisions are made at each node based on feature values.

## 🌟 Results
The classification accuracy of our model is **95%**, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between the different species of iris flowers.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Experiment with more advanced algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
